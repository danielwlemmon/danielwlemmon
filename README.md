I didn’t know it at the time, but I fell in love with software development early on.  In high school I couldn’t get enough of my programming classes.  Throughout my career and personal life, I’ve been drawn to technology.  
In my spare time I can be caught producing electronic music under the alias LiftChain (you can google me, it’s ok, I’ll wait…).  In my career, I have enjoyed designing and implementing systems for training, onboarding and maintaining a quality technician staff.  
As I learned about frameworks like React.js, Angular.js and iterative approaches like Agile Project Management, I find myself having to be pulled away from working.  I’m always looking forward to the next time I can code.
Recent years I’ve felt myself drawn to contribute in a more broad sense; helping people through technology is really where my heart is.
I’m elated to build upon my accomplishments at Kaiser Permanente, and combine my talents, skills and passions in software development.

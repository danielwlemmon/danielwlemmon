My name is Daniel Lemmon and I’m looking for the next opportunity where I can have an impact as a Frontend Software Developer. I’ve always enjoyed working on logic problems, I once took an IQ test just for fun. These days I live for those “flow state” days that happen while writing code and troubleshooting issues.
I’m always looking to learn new technologies, for example, I recently learned React Native and deployed my first mobile app to the Apple App Store. In addition, I have been in a position to interact with clients, determining their project requirements, and turning them into a reality. I currently contribute to a project for the React Denver meetup group. I have hands-on experience with React, React Remix, React Native, Javascript/Typescript, and many other technologies.
Even before receiving my extensive formal education, I was building front-end applications using Javascript, CSS, and HTML5. During this process, I learned that my optimal role would include a lot of the front-end algorithm and logical functions/components of a program, with a smaller amount of UI/UX and back-end work. During a recent full-stack project, I naturally became a leader within the team. As time permitted, I worked 1:1 with the other team members to optimize their growth and understanding of the project.
I thrive as a well-rounded and productive team member with an extensive background in face-to-face customer service combined with my natural technological talents.
